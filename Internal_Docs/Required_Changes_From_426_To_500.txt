This file describes changes that will have to be made in UE4SS in order to support Unreal Engine 5+
This is as of May 27th 2021, this entire file is based on the first early access version of UE5

ObjectProperty & ClassProperty
Added ObjectPtrProperty & ClassPtrProperty
These new properties seem to exist side-by-side with the old ObjectProperty & ClassProperty properties
In the dumped objects & properties file there are entries for both, maybe this is just a transition thing and everything will be the PtrProperty in the final UE5 release ?
I don't yet know what the differences between the two are.
ObjectPtrProperty inherits from ObjectProperty and ClassPtrProperty inherits from ClassProperty and neither have extra member variables


StaticConstructObject_Internal
A new 11th param was added to the params struct, it can be nullptr.


AOBs
The following AOBs need to be updated:
StaticFindObject
FString~FString

FHitResult struct
The bitfield that contains 'bBlockingHit' & 'bStartPenetrating' was moved from the top of the struct to the bottom of the struct
