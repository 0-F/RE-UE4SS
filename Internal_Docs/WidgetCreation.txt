Create a type that inherits from UUserWidget
Don't know how yet

Call the following on the created type
UUserWidget::CreateWidget<WidgetT, OwnerT>
Call UUserWidget::CreateInstanceInternal

UUserWidget::CreateInstanceInternal
Call NewObject
Call SetPlayerContext on the created object
Call Initialize on the created object

UObjectGlobals::NewObject
Disallow Name == NAME_None
Call StaticConstructObject_Internal
Seems doable

UUserWidget::SetPlayerContext
Non-virtual, non-UFunction
Iterate all user widgets in the UPROPERTY 'WidgetTree', which is a TObjectPtr<UWidgetTree>
PlayerContext is a non-reflected member of UUserWidget so access to it might not be very consistent
Maybe possible, have to look into the iterator

UUserWidget::Initialize
Is virtual, therefore, just call it
Home of this function is UUserWidget, it's not an override
