The 'Unreal' module
{
    The function 'Internal::UnrealScriptFunctionHook' should have an error handler mechanism.
    That way we can execute 'luaL_traceback' (or handle_lua_error) without involving Lua in the 'Unreal' module.
}

UE4SS
{
    Lua 2.0 must be integrated properly with the 'Mod' class.
    After that we can put all the static variables in there and clean them up upon reinstall/uninstall and unregister hooks etc.

    Change the 'FindAllOf' custom implementation to return a Lua table instead of Array.
    As good and fun as it is to be able to return an Array, it breaks compatibility with UE4SS 1.3.

    Make "RegisterHook" and "NotifyOnNewObject" callbacks and probably any other possibly-async code execution use a different lua state.
    Prefer to use luaL_newstate over lua_newthread if possible. May need to setup some complicated system for safe cross-state variable or environment access.
