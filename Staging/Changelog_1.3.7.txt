* The global function "RegisterHook" now returns two integers that represent pre & post callback ids.
  These ids can be passed to the "UnregisterHook" global function to unhook a function.
* Note that the callbacks for "RegisterHook" and "NotifyOnNewObject" execute in the game thread so the code in these callbacks needs to be careful when accessing Lua variables outside the callbacks.
* Added the global function "UnregisterHook", see API.txt for more information.
* Added better support for TArray. Now it can be used as out parameter in functions correctly.

Fixes
* Fixed a rare crash that could occur when interacting with parameters in callbacks passed to "RegisterHook".
* Fixed a bug which prohibited using variables, containing unreal objects created in other thread (in main from game and vise versa)
* Fixed most issues with GC of cirtain Lau functions.
