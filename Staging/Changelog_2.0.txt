## NEW:

Live View Debugger - Allows runtime viewing of Objects in GObject with live updates to property and variable values.
Enable the Debug log in UE4SS-settings.ini to activate.
```[Debug]
; Whether to enable the external UE4SS debug console.
ConsoleEnabled = 1
GuiConsoleEnabled = 1
GuiConsoleVisible = 1```

Watches - Allows watching of values in an object instance. Can print to a new tab or print to a file with timestamps.
Dumpers - NEW: Static Mesh dumper and All Actor dumper - Dumps positions of all loaded SM or all actors to a CSV file which can be loaded in UE to recreate a map or spawn actors at specific locations.  Very early feature, will allow for more properties to be dumped over time.

### Note: Actor dumper requires a specific dll to be compiled correctly for <=4.19 and =>4.20 for now.  Download the version for the engine version you will be working on if you'd like to use the dumper.
Download v2.0-UE419 for 4.19 and below.
Download v2.0-UE420 for 4.20 and above.

## Lua:
* The global function "RegisterHook" now returns two integers that represent pre & post callback ids.
  These ids can be passed to the "UnregisterHook" global function to unhook a function.
* Note that the callbacks for "RegisterHook" and "NotifyOnNewObject" execute in the game thread so the code in these callbacks needs to be careful when accessing Lua variables outside the callbacks.
* Added the global function "UnregisterHook", see API.txt for more information.
* Added better support for TArray. Now it can be used as out parameter in functions correctly.

## Fixes
* Fixed a rare crash that could occur when interacting with parameters in callbacks passed to "RegisterHook".
* Fixed a bug which prohibited using variables, containing unreal objects created in other thread (in main from game and vise versa)
* Fixed most issues with GC of cirtain Lau functions.
