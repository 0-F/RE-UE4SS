## New

# Live View Debugger
* Add live editing of properties.  May be unstable with certain structs.  Please report crashes with an Issue.


# Keybinds
* The old lua mods that only registered a key bind (ObjectDumperMod, UHTCompatibleHeaderGeneratorMod, & CXXHeaderGeneratorMod) have been removed.
* If you have an old mod installed, it takes precedence over the new mod.
* The new mod will have all keybinds listed at the top of the file to make it easy to see which key binds are already in use. 



# Lua
* Add default mod - LineTrace for object name
* Add default mod - SplitScreen
* New ExecuteInGameThread function for improved compatibility with certain internal UE functions



## Fixes

# UHT Generation
* Praydog - Fixed certain possible crashes with UHT Generation
* Praydog - Fixed UHT Generation crashing on building stubs when Engine module dumping is enabled
* Allow Instanced specifier on Map properties where the value is a UObject base
* Add GetTypeHash inline function generation for structs used in Map properties

# General
* Praydog - StaticConstructObject: Fix crash when Params.Class is nullptr



## Known Issues
* Certain structs will cause crashes when live editing
* You must edit certain structs from the highest level rather than from the tree view to avoid crashes
