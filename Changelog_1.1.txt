New
* There's a new way to install & use UE4SS, using xinput1_3.dll. More information can be found in the installation guide.
* Added a UHT compatible header generator. Useful for creating BP mods.
* Added a caching system to the aob scanner. It will scan for everything during the first start,
and then it will use the cache for subsequent starts until either the game exe changed or the ue4ss dll changed.
* Added "InvalidateCacheIfDLLDiffers" to the settings file. When this is 0, the cache won't be invalidated if ue4ss.dll has changed.
* Each game can now have its own directory in the root directory of UE4SS, it will automatically be detected and its config & mods
folder will be used instead of the ones in the root directory or the "/Binaries/Win64" directory. This is an optional feature,
you can keep using UE4SS identically to how you've been using it in 1.0.
* Added support to the dumper for the 'DelegateFunction' of 'DelegateProperty','MulticastInlineDelegateProperty' &
'MulticastSparseDelegateProperty', the format is '[df: address]'.
* Added support for games that are compiled with the 'WITH_CASE_PRESERVING_NAME' flag.
An additional dll file is now shipped that should replace the normal one for these games.
* The log file is now re-created on every start of UE4SS.
* The files 'UE4SS.log' and 'UE4SS_ObjectDump.txt' are now always created in the working directory instead of always in the game executable directory.
* Added many new offsets that can be overridden in 'UE4SS-settings.ini', including the MapProperty offsets that were missing in 1.0.
* If there are AOBs or offsets that aren't found, there will now be a message in the log file that tells you what you can do about it.

Lua
* Added global function, 'ExecuteWithDelay', it asynchronously executes code after a specified delay. See API.txt for details.
* Added the 'UE4SS' class that has the member function, 'GetVersion', which returns 3 integers defining the UE4SS version, see API.txt.
* You can now use the FName table functions if you prefer that syntax over using ':', but remember to always pass an FName as the first parameter.

Fixes
* Fixed crash that occurred when hot-reloading mods if one or more Lua scripts had a syntax error.
* Fixed the hot-reload system not working if there was an error in one or more Lua scripts. Different problem than the above crash-fix.
* Fixed encoding problem. The result is that all generated files (such as log files and object dumper) are half as big.
